      <h2>Eddie Van Halen & The Power of Dynamics</h2>

        Eddie Van Halen, known for his innovative playing, often stressed the importance of having multiple guitarists to shape the sound. 
        Even though Van Halen's lineup famously had Eddie as the sole guitarist, he highlighted how rhythm and lead roles 
        bring balance to any band. "When you have another guitarist, it’s like having a safety net. You can experiment, push boundaries, 
        and the rhythm guitarist keeps the groove alive," Eddie once said.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eddie's technique involved intricate tapping and harmonic runs, but in live settings, he recognized the importance of working closely with 
        bassists and keyboardists to fill in gaps. He cited bands like Thin Lizzy and The Eagles—both known for having multiple guitarists— 
        as inspirations for the way different players can trade off roles seamlessly. According to Eddie, the real magic lies in the dynamics: 
        “One guitarist plays it safe, the other takes the risks."

      <h2>Dimebag Darrell & Layered Aggression</h2>

      <p>
        Dimebag Darrell, the legendary guitarist of Pantera, spoke passionately about how multiple guitarists can create a more layered, 
        aggressive sound. Though Pantera often operated with only Dimebag on guitar, he admired bands like Iron Maiden and Judas Priest, 
        where multiple guitarists contribute to harmonized leads. Dimebag believed that two guitars could amplify the intensity, 
        allowing for synchronized riffs and complex melodies.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It’s about the wall of sound," Dimebag once said. "When you’ve got two guitars playing slightly different parts, 
        the music feels bigger and meaner." For Dimebag, collaboration between guitarists wasn't just about filling space—it was 
        about challenging each other. He often jammed with other guitarists during tours, believing that musical growth comes 
        from these interactions. "One guitarist alone can shred, but two together can destroy," he quipped, reflecting his philosophy 
        on the power of teamwork.
